   <h1>Types of CSS</h1> 
CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) describes the HTML elements which are displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. It saves a lot of time. It controls the layout of multiple web pages at one time. It sets the font-size, font-family, color, background color on the page.

It allows us to add effects or animations to the website. We use CSS to display animations like buttons, effects, loaders or spinners, and also animated backgrounds.

Without using CSS, the website will not look attractive. There are 3 types of CSS which are below:

<ol></ol>

Inline CSS
<li>Internal / Embedded CSS</li>
<li>External CSS</li>
<li>Inline CSS is the CSS which is written inside the HTML file. </li></ol><br>

Embedded CSS is the CSS which is written inside the HTML tag. It is called as Embedded CSS.

External CSS is the CSS file which is located in another file. It is called as External CSS.</p>
